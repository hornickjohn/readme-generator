## Description

Prompts with asterisks won't advance until I provide non-empty input. The rest will omit that section from the final product if left blank.

## Usage

At the end I can choose a filepath that is either relative or absolute. If only a name is given, it will be stored in teh same directory as index.js. If no input is given, it will default to "README.md" in this same directory.

## Tests

Here are some optional testing instructions: please test this project.
