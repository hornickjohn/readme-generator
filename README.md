## Description

This project creates a CLI in which you are prompted for information about a project, and given a complete and formatted README file containing that information. This was created to help streamline the process of README creation for devs that don't want to keep doubling back to check on proper formatting and what sections to include.

## Usage

<p>To launch the process, navigate in your terminal to the location of index.js, and enter "node index.js". You will then be fed a sequence of prompts to respond to with information you want included in your readme. Prompts starting with asterisks will not accept empty input.</p><p>Your own markdown can be included for formatting - for example, 'p' or 'br' tags to create multiple sections of text. The final prompt will ask you for a filepath at which to save your README - a complete path or a relative path will work, no directory given will default to the same one in which you have index.js. No input at all will, in that same directory, create "README.md". Include filename and extension in your path.</p>
